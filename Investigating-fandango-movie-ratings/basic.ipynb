    "# Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "Both distributions above are strongly left skewed, suggesting that movie ratings on Fandango are generally high or very high. We can see there's no rating under 2 stars in the sample Hickey analyzed. The distribution of displayed ratings is clearly shifted to the right compared to the actual rating distribution, suggesting strongly that Fandango inflates the ratings under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fandango's officials replied that the biased rounding off was caused by a bug in their system rather than being intentional, and they promised to fix the bug as soon as possible. Presumably, this has already happened, although we can't tell for sure since the actual rating value doesn't seem to be displayed anymore in the pages' HTML.\n",

    "In this project, we'll analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis."
